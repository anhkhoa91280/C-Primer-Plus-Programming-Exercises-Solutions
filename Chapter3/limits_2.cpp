Desc: This program shows how integer types are treated in a C++ system.

1. Sam and Sue both have $32767
2. Add $1 to both accounts. Sue now has $32768, but Sam has -$32768.
	Reason: 
		32767 in binary 2's compliment system is expressed as 0111 1111 1111 1111
		32767 + 1 in binary is calculated and come up as 1000 0000 0000 0000
		1000 0000 0000 0000 is -32768
		Please refer to 2's compliment number system
3. Reset both accounts to have $0
4. Subtract both accounts by 1
5. Sam now has -1 which is correct becasue his acc type is unsigned thus can accomodate 
	negative integers
6. Sue now has $65535, which is incorect
	Reason:
	0 expressed in binary as :  0000 0000 0000 0000
	-1 expressed in binary as : 1111 1111 1111 1111
	Adding these 2 numbers you get: 1111 1111 1111 1111 (which is 65535 in an unsiged variable)
