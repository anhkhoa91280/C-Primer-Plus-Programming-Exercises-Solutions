 * Desc: This program shows template with multiple params in Stage 4 where var is
 * of the same type as expression.
 * Reference: C++ Primer Plus - 6th Edition
 *
 * Note: The return type of circumferrence() is not known at the point of
 * declaration because x & y have not been declared at that poin. So we use the
 * placeholder 'auto' for the return type, and 'auto' will deduce the type from
 * the expression x+y (using decltype).
