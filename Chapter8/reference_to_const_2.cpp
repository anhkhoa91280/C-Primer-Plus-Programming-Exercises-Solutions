 * Desc: This program illustrates situations when a reference is not bound directly
 * 	to a variable from the calling function. In this case, the ref is bound to a
 * 	temporary varialbe if:
 * 	1. the argument is of correct type but isn't a lvalue.
 * 	2. the argument is NOT of correct type but can be converted to the correct type.
 * 	3. the parameter is of reference to a constant (non-modifiable lvalue).
 *  lvalue: is data object the can be referenced by its address, eg; a 
 *  variable, an array element, a member of a structure, a reference, 
 *  a dereferenced pointer.	
 * Reference: C++ Primer Plus - 6th Edition.
