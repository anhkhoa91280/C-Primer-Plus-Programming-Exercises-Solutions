 * 	Union is used to save to data space where a variable requires to be 
 * 	represented in different data types but only 1 type at a time where Union's 
 * 	size is the same as the largest data member

//The following union only takes 10 bytes (id_char's size), not 14 byptes
//(sizeof(int) + sizeof(char)*10). Thus, save 4 bytes. 
//Conceptually, the more data types it must represent, the more saves an
//union would have 
union book_id {

	//union must know its size because
	//size of an union is the size of the largest member so
	//data type like std::string can't be used
	//Futhermore, std::sting is of C++ not C whereas union is a
	//C-style data structure
